### **GUI Player Authentication Plugin - Secure Your Server with PIN Authentication**  

ðŸ”’ **GUI Player Authentication** is a **Minecraft plugin** that enhances server security by requiring players to **set up and enter a secure PIN** before they can interact with the world. This plugin prevents unauthorized access, ensuring that only verified players can play.

## **ðŸ”¹ Features**
âœ… **PIN Registration & Login:** Players must register a **4-digit PIN** (or any other configured value) on their first login and use it for future authentications.  
âœ… **Custom Chest GUI:** Players enter their PIN using a visually appealing **Chest GUI** with **Light Blue Dye items** representing digits.  
âœ… **Auto-Kick System:** If a player **fails to authenticate within 30 seconds**, they will be **automatically kicked** from the server.  
âœ… **PIN Verification:** If the entered PIN is incorrect, the player is **kicked immediately** to prevent brute-force attempts.  
âœ… **Player Restrictions:** Until authentication is complete, players **cannot move, chat, execute commands, or interact** with the world.  
âœ… **Blindness Effect:** Unauthenticated players receive a **permanent blindness effect** until they log in successfully.  
âœ… **PIN Reset Command (`/resetpin`)**: Players can reset their PIN and register a new one at any time.

## **ðŸ”¹ How It Works**
1. **New Players:**  
   - Upon joining, if the player **has no PIN registered**, they are shown a **Register GUI** where they must **select a 4-digit PIN** (or however many digits the user inputs in `config.yml`.  
   - Once confirmed, the PIN is **stored securely in a SQLite database**, and the player is granted access to the server.  

2. **Returning Players:**  
   - If the player already has a PIN, they are shown the **Login GUI** and must enter their **correct PIN**.  
   - A correct PIN **removes all restrictions**, while an incorrect PIN results in an **immediate kick**.  

3. **Auto-Kick for Unauthenticated Players:**  
   - If a player **does not authenticate within 30 seconds**, they are **automatically kicked** from the server.  

4. **PIN Reset:**  
   - Players can use **`/resetpin`** to delete their PIN and start the registration process again.
